1.  can create very own variants of components by going to components and changing values in variants
    that will give me access to that variants when using that components like button variant i used for testing(not pushin that)
2.  lib folder is also added by shadcn it has function as cn very usefull it uses at various places
    helps in creating dynamic classes where there are cases where we create conflicting classes

    lets see example on second commit

    refer to (COMMIT - 2)

3. every folder i create is mapped to route 
    refer to (COMMIT - 3)

    - can you organization folder like (auth) and then create login inside

4.  created a custom layout inside (auth) which is only applicable those pages
    refer to (COMMIT - 4)

    (this can be used when we need sidebar with specific pages can create it in layout)

5.  [[...sign-in]] this gives access to all the routes inside that folder
